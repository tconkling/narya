 * occupant of a place that should be shared with other occupants of the
 * place. These objects are stored in the place object itself and are
 * updated when bodies enter and exit a place.
 *
 * <p> A system that builds upon the Crowd framework can extend this class to
 * include extra information about their occupants. They will need to provide a
 * derived {@link BodyObject} that creates and configures their occupant info
 * in {@link BodyObject#createOccupantInfo}.
 *
 * <p> Note also that this class implements {@link Cloneable} which means
 * that if derived classes add non-primitive attributes, they are
 * responsible for adding the code to clone those attributes when a clone
